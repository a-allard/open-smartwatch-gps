# Open-Smartwatch KiCAD files

Repo for kicad schematic, board and gerber files. This project is in development and is not ready for release.

#### Update as of 12/26/2022

The [original project ](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-gps) seems to have lost some momentum on development.  There is an [issue here](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-gps/issues/10) to discuss merging these changes into the original project.  One of the goals of this fork and update is to minimize any serious changes to [the os](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os).  If all goes well, the OS should be able to be dropped on here with little to no modifications.  (that is the goal time will tell for sure.)

## Tools

To view/modify the files from this repository install [KiCAD](https://kicad.org).  You'll need version 7.0 or higher.

### BOM

NOTE: **This is a preliminary BOM**  After testing this could change some.

[HTML BOM](https://github.com/a-allard/open-smartwatch-gps/blob/master/bom/OSW_GPS_Rev-4.0.html)  (best to download for a pretty view)

For actual parts you'll need
* [Digi-Key cart](https://www.digikey.com/short/5wz73v93) with most everything needed for a build of 1.
* [Display](https://www.buydisplay.com/1-28-inch-tft-lcd-display-240x240-round-circle-screen-for-smart-watch)
* A LiPo battery and battery connector (Have not yet been selected but you should be able to power this from USB for initial debugging.)
