# Open-Smartwatch KiCAD files

Repo for kicad schematic, board and gerber files. This project is in development and is not ready for release.

#### Update as of 12/26/2022

The [original project ](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-gps) seems to have lost some momentum on development.  There is an [issue here](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-gps/issues/10) to discuss merging these changes into the original project.  One of the goals of this fork and update is to minimize any serious changes to [the os](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os).  If all goes well, the OS should be able to be dropped on here with little to no modifications.  (that is the goal time will tell for sure.)

## Tools

To view/modify the files from this repository install [KiCAD](https://kicad.org).  You'll need version 6.0 or higher.  NOTE: Once Version 7 arrives in January of 2023 this repository will likely bump to version 7 provided it is reasonably stable.

## Schematic

NOT UP TO DATE!!!

As this project has been worked on the schematic has not been updated along way yet.  Once the schematic is finalized this (and the other docs) will get updated.
